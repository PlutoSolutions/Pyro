# [ info ]

This client is bad and I expected much better from GiantNuker and ionar. Don't use this as [Konas Rewrite](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/KonasRewrite) is much better than this...

GiantNuker worked on the client's security for 1.5+ years, but because it had so many problems he decided to ditch all his work and release Pyro 2.0 through a bad loader that didn't even have any obfuscation. But hey, atleast it loads very fast!

# [ how-to ]

</div>

1. Download pyrocrack.jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Pyro/releases)
0. Put it into your .minecraft/mods folder
0. Start the game

If it crashes try deleting your previous Pyro config from 1.4.1 or before (if you have one)
